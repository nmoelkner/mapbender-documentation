Button
******

The button element provides a push button widget. Some elements like `Legend <../elements/legend.html>`_ , `Layertree <layertree.html>`_, `FeatureInfo <feature_info.html>`_, `Line/Area Ruler <ruler.html>`_ and  `PrintClient <printclient.html>`_ need a button to be displayed/activated if not defined in a frame.

Buttons optionally can be grouped, so that only one button in a group can be active at any given time. This is done by the group paramter.
You can define a button that refers to a website or script using the click paramter.

Configuration
=============

     :scale: 80

* **Show label:** Enable or disable text (title) next to the button.
* **Title:** Title of the element. The title will be listed in "Layouts" and allows to distinguish between different buttons. It will be indicated if "Show label" is activated.
* **Tooltip:** Text, that will be indicated if the mouse hovers over the button for a longer time.
* **Icon:** Symbol of the button. Based on a CSS class.
* **Target:** Target element (Title(ID)) of the button. The target element will be triggered by clicking on the button. (e.g.: Print).
* **Click:** Refers to a website or a script (e.g.: http://mapbender3.org).
* **Group:** Adds the element to a group. Only one button of the group may be activated.
* **Action:** Method that is invoked when the button is activated. 
* **Deactivate:** Method that is invoked when the button is disabled.


Icons
-----

For some symbols you can choose between two different types of icons:

* A symbol based on a graphic (e.g. "About"),
* A symbol based on a font (e.g. "About (Font Awesome)").

The latter are based on a `IconSet <https://github.com/mapbender/icons>`_, which is delivered with Mapbender as a module. We recommend to use the symbols from this library.
