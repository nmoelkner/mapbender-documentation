GPS-Position
************

This element provides a button to navigate to your current position and display a symbol at that position. The scale will not be changed until you activate ``zoom to accuracy (zoom to accuracy on first position)``.

The function is built upon the `Geolocation-API <https://www.w3.org/TR/geolocation-API/>`_ by the W3C. To validate that your browser supports this functionality please take a look at the `Can I Use <http://caniuse.com/#feat=geolocation>`_ page. The function uses the ``High Accurcacy Parameter`` that forces the positioning via GPS. If your device is shipped with a GPS-receiver and if it is activated the positioning is more accurate. Otherwise the WIFI access-points are used for positioning.

The midpoint shows the probable position of the device, the outer circle the accuracy of the positioning, that means the region where the position is probably to find.

Compatibility: Internet Explorer and MS Edge devliver without a GPS-reciever at the machine imprecise informationen. This behaviour is also observable with other applications.
