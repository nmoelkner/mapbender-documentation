WMC Loader
**********

Mapbender can save configurations (see `WMC Editor <../elements/wmc_editor.html>`_). This configurations can be loaded with the element WMC loader.

You can add WMC Loader to your application as a selectbox or a button which opens a dialog.

When you choose a configuration, the services in the configuration will be merged in your existing application.

Controlling by URL
==================

Load a WMC by ID
------------------

To allow loading by ID you have to enable *Id Loader* in the configuration of the element. 

If you have a WMC with the id <wmcid> you may pass the URL parameter wmcid to load the WMC:


.. code-block:: php

  ?wmcid=<wmcid>
